          Efforts are under way to develop the world’s first operational quantum
          computers, which will mark a literal quantum leap forward in
          technology.

          The Australian quantum computing startup Silicon Quantum Computing
          revealed Friday that it has constructed the world’s first atomic-scale
          integrated circuit that will power a new breed of computing machines.

          While that’s an impressive feat by computer scientists from down under
          Sydney, its development was a remarkable two years ahead of schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost 10 years have passed since SQC announced that its Australian
          engineers had created the world’s first single-atom transistor.

          <b>Quantum Computers: Ultra-Powerful Machines</b>
        </h4>
        <p>
          In an interview with Patricia Karvelas of RN Breakfast, Michelle
          Simmons – the lead researcher at the University of New South Wales and
          founder of SQC – disclosed the technology had a vast number of
          potential applications, including the ability to design new materials,
          such as new types of drugs and molecules that could help increase food
          supply.

          Quantum computers employ transistors to encode information in the same
          way that conventional computers do. In contrast to conventional
          computers, the size of a quantum computer’s transistor is comparable
          to that of a single atom.
        </p>

          A quantum computer follows a different set of rules than a classical
          computer, which is the primary distinction. It is capable of operating
          with qubits, as opposed to the bits and bytes used by conventional
          computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Qubits are composed of atoms, photons, electrons or ions, as well as
          their corresponding control devices, which operate as computer memory
          and a processor.

        <h4>
          <b>The Technology Can Be Commercialized In 5 Years</b>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Possible applications for the most recent breakthrough include the
          construction of lighter and more powerful batteries for electric
          automobiles, solar panels, pharmaceuticals, and whole new materials
          and fertilizers to increase agricultural yield. In general, the
          computer can replicate natural elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Simmons, their invention might be commercialized in
          around five years.

          Meanwhile, the White House published last month a range of concepts
          aimed at maintaining the United States’ lead in the global race for
          quantum computing while limiting the threat posed by quantum devices
          that can break public-key cryptography.

          <b>Quantum Computers: A Threat To Cryptocurrency?</b>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Numerous scientists warn that quantum computers may be able to break
          the cryptographic encryption that safeguards smartphones, bank
          accounts, email accounts, and crypto wallets.
        </p>

          In October 2021, U.S. intelligence officials identified quantum
          computing as one of the five most significant foreign threats. The
          last four were artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, and
          biotechnology.
        </p>
        <p>
          LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange network, speculated
          that quantum computers could breach the encryption methods that
          protect Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
